### Description
This package contains the original phone book in arrays that is modified to 
allow for time testing of a search. In addition to that, the package also 
contains the Binary Search Tree version of this assignment that can also be 
timed. The timed files searches through a whole range in a text file and 
outputs the information into a csv file. It is noticable that both files 
have given mostly zeros for time duration, however, I noticed that linear
searching and traversing in the array version takes a significantly longer 
time to compute. 

## Results CSV File Paths
1. Original Array Structure: Phone Book Console Revised/cmake-build-debug/DataAnalysis.csv
2. New Binary Search Tree structure: cmake-build-debug/DataAnalysis.csv
